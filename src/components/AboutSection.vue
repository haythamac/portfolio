                    I'm a full-stack developer focused on building web applications with
                    <span class="text-foreground font-medium">Laravel</span> and
                    <span class="text-foreground font-medium">Vue.js</span>.
                    I enjoy the process of turning ideas into functional systems that people can actually use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I care about writing <span class="text-foreground font-medium">clean, maintainable code</span> —
                    not because it's trendy, but because it makes projects easier to build on and debug.
                    I believe in keeping things simple and focused on solving the actual problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What drives me is the satisfaction of completing meaningful projects.
                    I'd rather ship something useful than endlessly polish something that never sees the light of day.
